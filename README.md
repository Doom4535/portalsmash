PortalSmash
===========

Utility to connect to open WiFi and click through "captive portal"-type
agreements.

PortalSmash will scan, find open (or known, more on this later) WiFi, and
then try to connect to it, get an IP address, and get to the Web. If it
succeeds, it will keep checking the connection every few seconds, and restart
if it fails (allowing it to be used on mobile devices).

PortalSmash needs to be run as root, because otherwise DHClient and 
WPA_Supplicant don't do what it wants. (Sorry about that.)

PortalSmash derives from Malice Afterthought's Reticle project.

Which portals does it get through? Try it yourself and see, but it's
quite a few from a set of *very* basic heuristics. If you find one it
doesn't handle, I'd love to get a pull request from you. (Hint: open IRB,
load Mechanize, and work through it-- then send me the commands, and what
differentiates the portal you found from the portals I *do* solve.)

Dependencies
============
Ruby Mechanize and Ruby Trollop. Mechanize is kind of a heavy
library, but PortalSmash needs it to parse and interact with (often really
badly coded) captive portal pages. They can be installed with:

    gem install trollop mechanize

Usage
=====

    sudo ./portalsmash.rb [-d devicename] [-n netconfig file]
       
Netfile format
==============

PortalSmash allows a network key file to be specified that includes, well, keys
for networks. The file must be in YAML, and formatted approximately as so:

    ---
    NetName:
        key: ohboyitsakey 
    HypotheticalWPAE:
        username: foo
        password: bar

This will allow the program to connect to WiFi for which you have been given
credentials (e.g., your home WiFi network). PortalSmash will connect to known
networks before unknown networks.
